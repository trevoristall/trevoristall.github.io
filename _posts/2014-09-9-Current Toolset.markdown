I like to regularly examine my workflow and the tools that I use in order to improve. I feel that you must critically analyze each part of the chain to find those problematic pieces.

* late 2013 15” retina Macbook Pro. I was a PC for a long time, but the allure of retina displays and a unix CLI drew me to Apple and I couldn’t be happier for it.
+ Atom: Primary code editor. I really want to love Atom. It does it’s job well and looks good, but after playing with Vim and seeing some of the powerful tools it has I am having a hard time sticking with it.
+ Adobe CC 2014: Asset creation.
+ Sketch: Designs, Mockups, Logos. Sketch does a wonderful job with anything digital.
+ Live Reload: A happy land where browsers don’t need a Refresh button
+ Vagrant: no more cluttering up my dev machine with mamp, xampp, or other development stacks.
* iTerm2: Command line of awesome. (I highly recommend OhMyZsh as a companion)
